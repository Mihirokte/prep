> A gateway sits between your apps and model providers. Core features are provider routing, fallback, retries, rate limiting, secret references, observability, guardrails. Market split in 2026: **LiteLLM** is MIT OSS with 100+ providers, OpenAI-compatible, but breaks down around ~2000 RPS (8 GB memory, cascading failures in published benchmarks); best for Python, <500 RPS, dev/prototyping. **Portkey** is control-plane-positioned (guardrails, PII redaction, jailbreak detection, audit trails), went Apache 2.0 open-source March 2026, 20-40 ms latency overhead, $49/mo production tier. **Kong AI Gateway** built on Kong Gateway — Kong's own benchmark on same 12 CPUs: 228% faster than Portkey, 859% faster than LiteLLM; $100/model/month pricing (max 5 on Plus tier); enterprise-fit if you're already on Kong. **Bifrost** (Maxim AI) — automatic retries with configurable backoff, fallback to Anthropic on OpenAI 429. **Cloudflare / Vercel AI Gateways** — managed, zero-ops, basic retry. Data residency drives the self-host decision; Portkey and Kong sit in the middle with OSS + optional managed.

**Type:** Learn
**Languages:** Python (stdlib, toy gateway-routing simulator)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 17 · 01 (Managed LLM Platforms), Phase 17 · 16 (Model Routing)
**Time:** ~60 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Enumerate the seven core gateway features (routing, fallback, retries, rate limits, secrets, observability, guardrails).
- Map four 2026 gateways (LiteLLM, Portkey, Kong AI, Bifrost) to scale ceilings and use cases.
- Cite the Kong benchmark (228% vs Portkey, 859% vs LiteLLM) and explain why it matters for >500 RPS.
- Choose self-hosted vs managed given data residency and ops budget.

## The Problem

Your product calls OpenAI, Anthropic, and a self-hosted Llama. Each provider has a different SDK, error model, rate limit, and auth scheme. You want failover (if OpenAI 429s, try Anthropic), a single credential store, unified observability, and rate limits per tenant.

Reinventing this at the app layer couples every service to every provider. A gateway layer consolidates it into one process with one API (typically OpenAI-compatible) that fans out to providers.

## The Concept

### Seven core features

1. **Provider routing** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, self-hosted, etc. behind one API.
2. **Fallback** — on 429, 5xx, or quality failure, retry elsewhere.
3. **Retries** — exponential backoff, bounded attempts.
4. **Rate limits** — per-tenant, per-key, per-model.
5. **Secret references** — pull credentials from vault at runtime (never in app).
6. **Observability** — OTel + GenAI attributes (Phase 17 · 13) + cost attribution.
7. **Guardrails** — PII redaction, jailbreak detection, allowed-topics filters.

### LiteLLM — MIT OSS, Python

- 100+ providers, OpenAI-compatible, router config, fallback, basic observability.
- Breaks down around 2000 RPS in Kong's benchmark; 8 GB memory footprint, cascading failures under sustained load.
- Best fit: Python app, <500 RPS, dev/staging gateways, experimental routing.
- Cost: $0 for OSS; cloud free tier exists.

### Portkey — control plane positioning

- Apache 2.0 OSS as of March 2026. Guardrails, PII redaction, jailbreak detection, audit trails.
- 20-40 ms per-request latency overhead.
- $49/mo for production tier with retention + SLA.
- Best fit: regulated industries needing guardrails + observability bundled.

### Kong AI Gateway — the scale play

- Built on Kong Gateway (mature API gateway product, lua+OpenResty).
- Kong's own benchmark on 12-CPU equivalent: 228% faster than Portkey, 859% faster than LiteLLM.
- Pricing: $100/model/month, max 5 on Plus tier.
- Best fit: already on Kong; >1000 RPS; willing to license.

### Bifrost (Maxim AI)

- Automatic retries with configurable backoff.
- Fallback to Anthropic on OpenAI 429 is a canonical recipe.
- Newer entrant; commercial.

### Cloudflare AI Gateway / Vercel AI Gateway

- Managed, zero-ops. Basic retry and observability.
- Best fit: Edge-serving JavaScript apps on Cloudflare/Vercel.
- Limited compared to Kong/Portkey on guardrails and rate limits.

### Self-hosted vs managed

Data residency is the forcing function. Healthcare and finance default self-host (LiteLLM or Portkey OSS or Kong). Consumer products default managed (Cloudflare AI Gateway) or middle-tier (Portkey managed). Hybrid: self-hosted for regulated tenant, managed for others.

### Latency budget

- LiteLLM: 5-15 ms overhead typical.
- Portkey: 20-40 ms overhead.
- Kong: 3-8 ms overhead.
- Cloudflare/Vercel: 1-3 ms overhead (edge advantage).

Gateway latency directly adds to TTFT. For TTFT P99 < 100 ms SLA, Kong or Cloudflare. For P99 < 500 ms, any.

### Rate-limit semantics matter

Simple token-bucket works up to moderate scale. Multi-tenant requires sliding-window + burst allowance + per-tenant tiering. LiteLLM ships token-bucket; Kong ships sliding-window; Portkey ships tiered.

### Gateway + observability + routing compose

Phase 17 · 13 (observability) + 16 (model routing) + 19 (gateways) are the same layer in production. Pick one tool that covers all three or wire them carefully: most 2026 deployments combine Helicone (observability) or Portkey (guardrails) with Kong (scale) for split roles.

### Numbers you should remember

- LiteLLM: breaks at ~2000 RPS, 8 GB memory.
- Portkey: 20-40 ms overhead; Apache 2.0 since March 2026.
- Kong: 228% faster than Portkey, 859% faster than LiteLLM.
- Kong pricing: $100/model/month, 5 max on Plus tier.
- Cloudflare/Vercel: 1-3 ms overhead at the edge.

## Use It

`code/main.py` simulates gateway routing with fallback across 3 providers under 429/5xx injection. Reports latency, retry rate, and fallback hit rate.

## Ship It

This lesson produces `outputs/skill-gateway-picker.md`. Given scale, ops posture, compliance, latency budget, picks a gateway.
